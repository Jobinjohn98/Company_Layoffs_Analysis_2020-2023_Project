I recently completed a project analyzing company layoffs from 2020 to 2023 using SQL and Tableau. The project focused on extracting and processing layoff data across multiple industries during this period, marked by significant economic shifts. With SQL, I cleaned and aggregated the data to identify key trends, including peak layoff periods and the sectors most affected. In Tableau, I created an interactive dashboard that visualizes layoffs by industry, geography, and company, offering stakeholders a comprehensive view of how external factors, such as the pandemic and market conditions, influenced workforce reductions.
